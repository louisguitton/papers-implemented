    "### Notes from videos\n",
    "\n",
    "- logistic regression on n number of words BoW has to learn n+1 parameters (for bias)\n",
    "- another interesting embedding for simple models is to look at the per-class word frequencies, and then embed the document with the m number of classes\n",
    "- logistic regression = sigmoid function on parameter theta\n",
    "- learn theta = cost function as contour plot + gradient descent\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 1.1: Sigmoid\n",
    "You will learn to use logistic regression for text classification. \n",
    "* The sigmoid function is defined as: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ h(z) = \\frac{1}{1+\\exp^{-z}} \\tag{1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It maps the input 'z' to a value that ranges between 0 and 1, and so it can be treated as a probability. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logistic regression: regression and a sigmoid\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression takes a regular linear regression, and applies a sigmoid to the output of the linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression:\n",
    "$$z = \\theta_0 x_0 + \\theta_1 x_1 + \\theta_2 x_2 + ... \\theta_N x_N$$\n",
    "Note that the $\\theta$ values are \"weights\". If you took the Deep Learning Specialization, we referred to the weights with the `w` vector.  In this course, we're using a different variable $\\theta$ to refer to the weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression\n",
    "$$ h(z) = \\frac{1}{1+\\exp^{-z}}$$\n",
    "$$z = \\theta_0 x_0 + \\theta_1 x_1 + \\theta_2 x_2 + ... \\theta_N x_N$$\n",
    "We will refer to 'z' as the 'logits'.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 1.2 Cost function and Gradient\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost function used for logistic regression is the average of the log loss across all training examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$J(\\theta) = -\\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^m y^{(i)}\\log (h(z(\\theta)^{(i)})) + (1-y^{(i)})\\log (1-h(z(\\theta)^{(i)}))\\tag{5} $$\n",
    "* $m$ is the number of training examples\n",
    "* $y^{(i)}$ is the actual label of the i-th training example.\n",
    "* $h(z(\\theta)^{(i)})$ is the model's prediction for the i-th training example.\n",
    "\n",
    "The loss function for a single training example is\n",
    "$$ Loss = -1 \\times \\left( y^{(i)}\\log (h(z(\\theta)^{(i)})) + (1-y^{(i)})\\log (1-h(z(\\theta)^{(i)})) \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* All the $h$ values are between 0 and 1, so the logs will be negative. That is the reason for the factor of -1 applied to the sum of the two loss terms.\n",
    "* Note that when the model predicts 1 ($h(z(\\theta)) = 1$) and the label $y$ is also 1, the loss for that training example is 0. \n",
    "* Similarly, when the model predicts 0 ($h(z(\\theta)) = 0$) and the actual label is also 0, the loss for that training example is 0. \n",
    "* However, when the model prediction is close to 1 ($h(z(\\theta)) = 0.9999$) and the label is 0, the second term of the log loss becomes a large negative number, which is then multiplied by the overall factor of -1 to convert it to a positive loss value. $-1 \\times (1 - 0) \\times log(1 - 0.9999) \\approx 9.2$ The closer the model prediction gets to 1, the larger the loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Update the weights\n",
    "\n",
    "To update your weight vector $\\theta$, you will apply gradient descent to iteratively improve your model's predictions.  \n",
    "The gradient of the cost function $J$ with respect to one of the weights $\\theta_j$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\nabla_{\\theta_j}J(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^m(h^{(i)}-y^{(i)})x_j \\tag{5}$$\n",
    "* 'i' is the index across all 'm' training examples.\n",
    "* 'j' is the index of the weight $\\theta_j$, so $x_j$ is the feature associated with weight $\\theta_j$\n",
    "\n",
    "* To update the weight $\\theta_j$, we adjust it by subtracting a fraction of the gradient determined by $\\alpha$:\n",
    "$$\\theta_j = \\theta_j - \\alpha \\times \\nabla_{\\theta_j}J(\\theta) $$\n",
    "* The learning rate $\\alpha$ is a value that we choose to control how big a single update will be.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or:\n",
    " $$z = \\mathbf{x}\\mathbf{\\theta}$$\n",
    " $$h(z) = sigmoid(z)$$\n",
    " $$J = \\frac{-1}{m} \\times \\left(\\mathbf{y}^T \\cdot log(\\mathbf{h}) + \\mathbf{(1-y)}^T \\cdot log(\\mathbf{1-h}) \\right)$$\n",
    " $$\\mathbf{\\theta} = \\mathbf{\\theta} - \\frac{\\alpha}{m} \\times \\left( \\mathbf{x}^T \\cdot \\left( \\mathbf{h-y} \\right) \\right)$$\n"

    "## Week 2: Naive Bayes\n",
    "Naive bayes is an algorithm that could be used for sentiment analysis. It takes a short time to train and also has a short prediction time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### So how do you train a Naive Bayes classifier?\n",
    "- The first part of training a naive bayes classifier is to identify the number of classes that you have.\n",
    "- You will create a probability for each class.\n",
    "$P(D_{pos})$ is the probability that the document is positive.\n",
    "$P(D_{neg})$ is the probability that the document is negative.\n",
    "Use the formulas as follows and store the values in a dictionary:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(D_{pos}) = \\frac{D_{pos}}{D}\\tag{1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(D_{neg}) = \\frac{D_{neg}}{D}\\tag{2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $D$ is the total number of documents, or tweets in this case, $D_{pos}$ is the total number of positive tweets and $D_{neg}$ is the total number of negative tweets.\n",
    "#### Prior and Logprior\n",
    "\n",
    "The prior probability represents the underlying probability in the target population that a tweet is positive versus negative.  In other words, if we had no specific information and blindly picked a tweet out of the population set, what is the probability that it will be positive versus that it will be negative? That is the \"prior\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The prior is the ratio of the probabilities $\\frac{P(D_{pos})}{P(D_{neg})}$.\n",
    "We can take the log of the prior to rescale it, and we'll call this the logprior\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{logprior} = log \\left( \\frac{P(D_{pos})}{P(D_{neg})} \\right) = log \\left( \\frac{D_{pos}}{D_{neg}} \\right)$$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that $log(\\frac{A}{B})$ is the same as $log(A) - log(B)$.  So the logprior can also be calculated as the difference between two logs:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{logprior} = \\log (P(D_{pos})) - \\log (P(D_{neg})) = \\log (D_{pos}) - \\log (D_{neg})\\tag{3}$$\n",
    "#### Positive and Negative Probability of a Word\n",
    "To compute the positive probability and the negative probability for a specific word in the vocabulary, we'll use the following inputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $freq_{pos}$ and $freq_{neg}$ are the frequencies of that specific word in the positive or negative class. In other words, the positive frequency of a word is the number of times the word is counted with the label of 1.\n",
    "- $N_{pos}$ and $N_{neg}$ are the total number of positive and negative words for all documents (for all tweets), respectively.\n",
    "- $V$ is the number of unique words in the entire set of documents, for all classes, whether positive or negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use these to compute the positive and negative probability for a specific word using this formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(W_{pos}) = \\frac{freq_{pos} + 1}{N_{pos} + V}\\tag{4} $$\n",
    "$$ P(W_{neg}) = \\frac{freq_{neg} + 1}{N_{neg} + V}\\tag{5} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that we add the \"+1\" in the numerator for additive smoothing.  This [wiki article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_smoothing) explains more about additive smoothing.\n",
    "#### Log likelihood\n",
    "To compute the loglikelihood of that very same word, we can implement the following equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{loglikelihood} = \\log \\left(\\frac{P(W_{pos})}{P(W_{neg})} \\right)\\tag{6}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implement `naive_bayes_predict`\n",
    "**Instructions**:\n",
    "Implement the `naive_bayes_predict` function to make predictions on tweets.\n",
    "* The function takes in the `tweet`, `logprior`, `loglikelihood`.\n",
    "* It returns the probability that the tweet belongs to the positive or negative class.\n",
    "* For each tweet, sum up loglikelihoods of each word in the tweet.\n",
    "* Also add the logprior to this sum to get the predicted sentiment of that tweet.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ p = logprior + \\sum_i^N (loglikelihood_i)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note\n",
    "Note we calculate the prior from the training data, and that the training data is evenly split between positive and negative labels (4000 positive and 4000 negative tweets).  This means that the ratio of positive to negative 1, and the logprior is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of 0.0 means that when we add the logprior to the log likelihood, we're just adding zero to the log likelihood.  However, please remember to include the logprior, because whenever the data is not perfectly balanced, the logprior will be a non-zero value."
