    "# Week 1: Neural Machine Translation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Seq2Seq suffers for long sentences because it has a fixed-termed memory length. Attention was brought up to get around that issue. (=it gives more weight to important words)\n",
    "- Alignment is used for word sense disambiguation\n",
    "- metaphor for attention's key, query, value triplet: \"Mom, I'm looking for my keys.\" then Mom thinks about the usual places your keys are and tells you what it the most likely place to find your keys. Attention is like a process to save time by looking in the place where the key is the most likely to be. \n",
    "- Keys and values are pairs, both coming from the encoder hidden state, whiles queries come from the decoder hidden states.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Teacher forcing provides faster training and higher accuracy by allowing the model to use the decoderâ€™s actual output to compare its predictions against\n",
    "- Evaluate machine translation models with BLEU and ROUGE scores\n",
    "- to sample and decode, there are multiple methods like :\n",
    "    - beam search which uses conditional probabilities and the beam width parameter\n",
    "    - MBR (minimum Bayes risk) takes several samples and compare them against each other to find the golden one\n",
    "    - greedy decoding \n",
    "    - random sampling"
